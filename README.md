##### Feature Ideas

- A lot to unpack here: https://www.collectorz.com/game/video-game-database
- Potentially update layout w/ grid: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-css-grid-holy-grail-layout

##### To Do

- [ ] Make sure all API routes are protected by middleware, and if not, add `getAuth` checks
- [ ] Maybe add search bar to nav for searching for a game && Make the page an SSR'd one
